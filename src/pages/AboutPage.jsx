      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        TANGLE is a project presented by two junior coders. In the struggle to
        find work we found the need to show our portfolios in a dynamic and
        agile way. Not too centered in the code but more in the final product.
        For piers and recruiters to be able to see basic info immediately and
        jump in a deployed demo right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to TANGLE, a space created by developers, for developers. We are

        the developers community.
